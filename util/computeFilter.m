function [filterCausal, filterAnticausal] = computeFilter(stim, response, filterPts, ...
    correctStimPower, frequencyCutoff, samplingInterval)
% Computes filter that best predicts response given white noise stimulus. This
% is the cross-correlation between stimulus and response.
%
% Input:
%   stim       - matrix of row vectors
%   response   - matrix of row vectors
%   filterPts  - length of filter (one side of filter, causal or anti-causal
%                half)
%   correctStimPower  - (optional) boolean, controls whether filter power is
%                       divided by stimulus power
%   frequencyCutoff   - (optional) used, along with samplingInterval, to apply
%                       frequency cutoff to filter. Must also supply a sampling 
%                       frequency.
%   samplingInterval  - (optional) used to apply frequency cutoff to filter.
%
% Output:
%   filterCausal      - causal half of filter (acts on stimuli occurring before
%                       time 0)
%   filterAnticausal  - anticausal half of filter (acts on stimuli occurring
%                       after time 0). Structure in this half is entirely due to
%                       auto-correlation in stimulus.
